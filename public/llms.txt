## Site Information
Name: JSON TO TOON Converter
URL: https://www.jsontotoon.site
Description: Free online tool that converts JSON to TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format to reduce LLM token usage by 30-60%, helping developers cut API costs for GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and other large language models.

## Purpose
This website provides a browser-based converter that transforms JSON data into a more token-efficient format called TOON. The conversion happens entirely client-side, ensuring user privacy and data security. By eliminating redundant JSON keys, brackets, and punctuation, TOON format can reduce token counts by 30-60% on average, resulting in significant cost savings for LLM API usage.

## Key Features
- 100% client-side processing - data never leaves the user's device
- Free forever - no account, signup, or payment required
